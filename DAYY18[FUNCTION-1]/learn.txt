1. Arrow Function:

     ---A concise way to write functions using the => syntax.

Example:

   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5


2. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

     --- A function that runs as soon as it is defined.

Example:
        (function () {
               console.log("This is an IIFE function!");
        })();


3. Callback Function

     --- A function passed as an argument to another function.

Example:
         function greet(name, callback) {
             console.log("Hello, " + name);
              callback();
         }

       function sayBye() {
              console.log("Goodbye!");
        }
          
        greet("Vrushali", sayBye);


4. Higher Order Function

      --- A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.

Example:

      function multiplyBy(factor) {
         return function (number) {
          return number * factor;
       };
       }

      const double = multiplyBy(2);
      console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10



Difference between them:
- Arrow Function: Short syntax for writing functions, does not have its own 'this'.
- IIFE: Function that executes immediately after it is defined, often used to create a private scope.
- Callback Function: Function passed as an argument to another function, used for asynchronous operations or event handling.
- Higher Order Function: Function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function, used for abstraction and functional programming.
