EVENTS 
-- There are many types of events in js.
such as click, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove, keydown, keyup, keypress, load, unload, resize, scroll, etc.
-- We can use event listeners to handle these events.
-- Event listeners are functions that are called when an event occurs.

// get the elements
// add event
// name_of_event.addEventListener

addEventListener needs two things :

addEventListener : 1] name of the event
                   2] function

-- We can add event listeners to elements using the addEventListener() method.
-- The addEventListener() method takes two arguments: the event type and the event listener function.
-- The event listener function is called when the event occurs.
 
 // Example of event listener
 document.addEventListener("click", function(){
    console.log("You clicked the document");
    });
