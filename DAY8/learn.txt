TODAY WE LEARN ABOUT JAVASCRIPT ALERT, CONFIRM, PROMPT, AND INPUT METHODS

1. alert() :
==> The alert() method displays an alert dialog with a message and an OK button.

SYNTAX: 
         alert("Please fill the name !");
         => Shows a popup with the message "You are hacked!"

  - Has only one button: OK
  - Returns undefined
  - Blocks further execution until the user clicks OK

  EX.:
     alert("Warning:Storage is almost full !");
     --  User must click OK to continue
  
2. confirm()
==>  The confirm() method displays a dialog with a message, OK button, and Cancel button.

SYNTAX : 
       let result = confirm("Do you want to logout ?");
       console.log(result); 
        - true if OK, false if Cancel
        - Shows a popup with the specified message

   - Has two buttons: OK and Cancel
   - Returns true if OK is clicked
   - Returns false if Cancel is clicked
   - Blocks further execution until the user responds

EX.: 

       if (confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this?")) {
          console.log("Item deleted");
       } else {
          console.log("Deletion cancelled");
       }

3. prompt() :
==> The prompt() method displays a dialog with a message, text input field, OK button, and Cancel button.

SYNTAX : 
         let name = prompt("Please enter your name:", "John Doe");
         console.log(name); 
         - User's input or null
         - Shows a popup with the specified message and optional default value

   - Has two buttons: OK and Cancel
   - Returns the entered string if OK is clicked
   - Returns null if Cancel is clicked
   - Blocks further execution until the user responds

EX.:
       let age = prompt("How old are you?", "18");
       if (age !== null) {
          console.log(`You are ${age} years old`);
       } else {
        console.log("You cancelled the prompt");
       }

       
Note: These methods are synchronous and modal - they pause JavaScript execution until the user responds. Overuse can create a poor user experience.
